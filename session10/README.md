# Assignment: ResNet Architecture for CIFAR10

## Overview

This assignment implements a ResNet architecture for the CIFAR10 dataset. The solution utilizes the custom ResNet implementation provided in the PyPI package Models (version 0.1.1), which can be installed via the following command:

```bash
pip install ERA-V2-Architecture==0.1.1
```


However, due to time constraints, the Models package does not satisfy the requirements outlined in the assignment. Therefore, the ResNet architecture specified in the assignment prompt will be implemented in the furture.
