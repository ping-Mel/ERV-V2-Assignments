# Project Overview

 This assignment is structured into two main parts, each focusing on different aspects of the assignment. Below, you'll find links to each part, along with a brief description of what to expect in each.

## Assignment Structure

The Assignment is divided into two parts, housed in their respective subfolders:

- **[Part 1: Neural Network Backpropagation Simulation in Excel](part1/)** - This section demonstrates the fundamentals of neural network training through forward and backward propagation using a custom Excel sheet.

- **[Part 2: Improved CNN Model for Enhanced Accuracy](part2/)** - In this part, we enhance the model's accuracy and regularization capabilities by adopting  both Batch Normalization and Dropout techniques
