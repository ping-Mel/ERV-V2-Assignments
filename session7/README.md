## Project Objective

### Performance Target
- Achieve a **consistent accuracy of 99.4%** over the last few epochs in the model's training phase. This metric should reflect steady performance, not a one-off peak.

### Constraints
- Train the model for **no more than 15 epochs**.
- Design the model with **less than 8000 parameters**.

### Implementation Approach
- Utilize the **modular code** practices for efficient model development.
- Store each variant of the model in the `model.py` file, naming them sequentially (e.g., Model_1, Model_2, etc.).

### Documentation Steps
1. Develop the model in three clearly defined steps.
2. Include a **"target, result, analysis"** section in each file, placed at either the beginning or the end, to outline objectives, outcomes, and insights.
3. Justify the chosen performance target, detailing the rationale behind it. Ensure that the analysis provided is accurate and logically sound.

### Purpose
This structure is designed to streamline the development process, ensure clarity of objectives and results, and foster a rigorous analytical approach to model evaluation. Documenting the rationale behind target settings will enhance the understanding of the model's performance and decision-making process.
