## Project Objective

### Performance Target
- Achieve a **consistent accuracy of 99.4%** over the last few epochs in the model's training phase. This metric should reflect steady performance, not a one-off peak.

### Constraints
- Train the model for **no more than 15 epochs**.
- Design the model with **less than 8000 parameters**.

### Implementation Approach
- Utilize the **modular code** practices for efficient model development.
- Store each variant of the model in the `model.py` file, naming them sequentially (e.g., `NetA`, `NetB`, `NetC`, and `NetD`).

### Overview of Model Training and Data Augmentation
In our s7.ipynb notebook, we explore the nuances of neural network training and optimization through a systematic approach, focusing on four distinct models (NetA, NetB, NetC, and NetD) and the strategic use of data augmentation techniques. Each component of our exploration serves a specific purpose:

#### Models Overview
**NetA**: Designed as a baseline, this model incorporates fundamental convolutional layers to establish a starting point for accuracy and performance on our dataset. It helps us understand the impact of a straightforward architecture.

**NetB**: A variation that introduces complexity reduction by adjusting channel sizes and layer depth. The purpose is to observe how reducing model complexity affects learning efficiency and generalization.

**NetC**: This model experiments with advanced features such as batch normalization and dropout layers to enhance model stability and reduce overfitting. It allows us to gauge the effectiveness of regularization techniques in convolutional neural networks.

**NetD**: Represents a more sophisticated architecture with a focus on deeper layers and more nuanced data flow. It serves to test the limits of performance improvement through architectural complexity and advanced layer configurations

#### Data Augmentation Tuning
Data augmentation plays a crucial role in enhancing model robustness and preventing overfitting. Through systematic parameter tuning of augmentation techniques like ColorJitter, RandomRotation, and RandomErasing.

#### Notebook Approach: `Target`, `Result`, and `Analysis`
Our notebook follows a structured approach to model exploration:

1. **Target**: Each training session is driven by specific goals, such as improving accuracy, reducing overfitting, or testing the impact of an architectural change.

2. **Result**: We meticulously document the outcomes of each experiment, including model accuracy, performance metrics, and any observed trends.

3. **Analysis**: Critical analysis follows each result, offering insights into why certain changes led to improvements or declines in model performance.

By documenting our journey through the steps of model training and tuning, we aim to provide a comprehensive resource that empowers others to experiment with and refine their neural network models, paving the way for innovation and advancement in the field.
